title: Hiring is Active Investing: Reflecting on the Limits of Structured Interviews
description: Similar to active investing, a wide body of research (both academic and corporate) shows hiring managers rarely outperform the index (chance). For example, case study evaluations and coding evaluation scores consistently show very poor predictability for later job performance. I explore what productive interview cycles could instead focus on (for both sides).

# Hiring is Active Investing: Reflecting on the Limits of Interviews & What To Do About It

## The Team Is Every Organization's Most Important Product
It may sound cliche in 2025, but it must be emphasized at the top that every organization's team is the most important product.  The team is its destiny.


## A Brief History of Active Investing
- Index investing versus consistent active performance (Benjamin Graham to Vanguard and recent hedge fund performance)


## A Brief Overview of Interviews And Their Relative Effectiveness
- Generally, interviews aim to filter candidate pools to identify the candidates who will perform the best
- While not perfect, we are now awash in job performance data

### Unstructured Interviews
- Very poor predictability of job performance


### Structured Interviews
- Case studies also have very poor job performance predictability
- Coding interviews (Google studies)


(high false negative and near 0 predictability)
Wingate, T. G., Bourdage, J. S., & Steel, P. (2024). Evaluating interview criterion-related validity for distinct constructs: A meta-analysis. International Journal of Selection and Assessment. DOI: 10.1111/ijsa.12494. (85 studies, n=30,000+; r=0.30 overall, but drops for contextual performance.)

Weekley & Gier (1987) within McDaniel: r=0.48 for sales (case-analog), but n=104 limits generalizability. Critique: Tan, H. (2023). Do consulting case study interviews work? A deep dive. StrategyU Blog. https://strategyu.co/case-studies-deep-dive/


(code interviews and brain teasers near 0 predictability, 10y of Google data)

### False Negatives
- Very, very few managers honestly track even basic hiring performance metrics; for example, False Negatives
Cite Rabois, others


### Evidence Indicates Hiring Managers Are Like Ignorant Active Investors



## So What To Do?
We are likely in the circumstance (systemically speaking, at least in the United States) of: 
a) knowing the importance of selecting a great team and 
b) not having effective tools to do so, but 
c) electing to spend enormous resources on interviewing so as to at least *give the impression we are taking team development very seriously and instituting all the best (ineffective) practices.*


### What Can Be Learned In Interview?

#### What Interviews Incentivize

(falsehoods and overclaims)
